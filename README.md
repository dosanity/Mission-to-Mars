## Project Overview
We are tasked to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about Mars. Web scraping is a method of gaining data from different sources quickly instead of visiting each website yourself and manually extracting data. The web scraping process is automated using a programming script. Web scraping is a method used by organizations worldwide to extract online data for analysis. We will then store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. This will centralize the data into one page to showcase information about the red planet.
