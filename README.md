## Project Overview
We are tasked to automate a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about Mars. Web scraping is a method of gaining data from different sources quickly instead of visiting each website yourself and manually extracting data. The web scraping process is automated using a programming script. Web scraping is a method used by organizations worldwide to extract online data for analysis. We will then store it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. This will centralize the data into one page to showcase information about the red planet. 

## Resources
+ Analysis Software: `Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12`, `VS Code 1.71.0`

## Website Properties

### Full Resolution Images
One can access the images of the Mars hemispheres by clicking on each individual thumbnail. This will open a new web browser with a full-resolution picture of the Mars hemispheres. This makes it easier to access photos linked with other websites. By hovering over the Mars hemispheres, the background color changes to orange to illustrate which hemisphere we are selecting.
